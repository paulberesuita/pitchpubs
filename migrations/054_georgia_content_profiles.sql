-- FADO IRISH PUB (MIDTOWN) -- Atlanta's EPL Supporter Hub
-- ============================================================
UPDATE bars SET content = '<h3>The Vibe</h3>
<p>Walk into Fado Midtown on any Premier League Saturday morning and you will find three different supporter groups in three different corners, each claiming their patch of this authentic Irish pub. At the corner of Peachtree and 8th Streets, this is where Atlanta''s English football culture lives and breathes. The Manchester United supporters fill one section in red, the Chelsea fans occupy another in blue, and the American Outlaws post up for USMNT matches with flags and scarves draped over every available surface.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>The entire interior was designed and constructed in Ireland, then shipped to Atlanta for installation. Deep woods, a proper Whiskey Room, iconic Irish beer branding, and specialty paint and fixtures create different experiences within a single space. Thirty-two screens across a 250-seat venue mean you can always find your match, and the staff knows which audio zone belongs to which group. The pub opens early for Premier League, Champions League, and international fixtures no matter how early they kick off.</p>

<h3>The Supporter Clubs</h3>
<p>Fado Midtown is the official gathering spot for three distinct supporter groups. ATLMUFC, the Manchester United Supporters Club of Atlanta, shows every Red Devils match here and sells official merch through the pub. The Atlanta Blues CFC, Chelsea''s official supporters club in the metro area, claims Fado as their home for all matches. And the American Outlaws Atlanta chapter makes this their base for USMNT and USWNT games, bringing the drums and chants that define AO culture.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>This is a proper Irish pub with a kitchen that takes its food seriously. Traditional Irish fare like fish and chips, shepherd''s pie, and a full Irish breakfast are complemented by an excellent whiskey selection. The bar pours a proper pint of Guinness and carries a strong selection of Irish and craft beers. Weekend brunch service means you can eat well while watching the early matches.</p>

<h3>Who Goes There</h3>
<p>The crowd splits depending on the match. Weekday Champions League nights bring a mixed crowd of football obsessives. Saturday and Sunday mornings belong to the EPL faithful, with Man United and Chelsea fans anchoring the space. USMNT qualifiers and tournament matches bring the biggest, loudest crowds. The pub also partners with Atlanta United for special events and watch parties, bridging the MLS and European football communities.</p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>
<p>Located on Peachtree Street in the heart of Midtown, Fado is walkable from the Midtown MARTA station. Street parking is available on surrounding blocks, and several parking decks are within a block. For World Cup 2026, the Midtown location puts you on the main transit corridor to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p>'

-- DER BIERGARTEN -- World Cup 2026 Ground Zero
-- ============================================================
UPDATE bars SET content = '<h3>The Vibe</h3>
<p>Der Biergarten is Atlanta''s soccer headquarters, and it knows it. The moment you step inside this 7,000-square-foot German beer garden on Marietta Street, you understand why it has been the spiritual home of Atlanta United supporters since the club launched in 2017. Rustic brick walls, warm wood accents, string lights over the elevated outdoor patio, and the sound of German beer steins clinking set the stage. On match days, this place transforms from a refined beer garden into a roaring supporters'' den.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>The indoor space includes an elegant dining room, a games alley with Fussball tables and table shuffleboard, and the signature indoor/outdoor beer garden. Multiple large screens are positioned throughout, with dedicated audio for the main match. The outdoor patio is the real draw on nice days, offering an open-air atmosphere that makes watching a daytime kickoff feel like being at a European fan zone. Der Biergarten is steps from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Georgia Aquarium, and CNN Center.</p>

<h3>World Cup 2026</h3>
<p>Atlanta is a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Der Biergarten''s location makes it arguably the most important pre-match and watch-party venue in the city. It sits within walking distance of the stadium, and its German beer garden identity is tailor-made for World Cup culture. The team has already begun planning expanded viewing events for the tournament, with outdoor projections and extended capacity during match days.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>This is a proper German beer garden with premium German beers on tap, served in authentic steins. The food menu features traditional German cuisine -- bratwurst, schnitzel, pretzels with beer cheese, and currywurst alongside more familiar pub fare. The combination of cold German beer and match-day tension is something special. A cocktail program and wine list round out the offerings for non-beer drinkers.</p>

<h3>Atlanta United Connection</h3>
<p>As an official Atlanta United Pub Partner, Der Biergarten hosts watch parties for every match with ticket giveaways, special events, and promotional activations. Pre-match crowds heading to Mercedes-Benz Stadium for Five Stripes home games often start here, and the energy carries right into the stadium. It has been a consistent destination for Atlanta''s soccer community since the club''s founding season.</p>

<h3>Insider Tips</h3>
<p>Arrive early for any Atlanta United home match or major international fixture. The patio fills fast. During World Cup 2026, this will be one of the most popular gathering spots in the city, so plan accordingly. The Fussball tables in the back alley are a great way to kill time before kickoff.</p>'

-- THE MIDWAY PUB -- Footie Mob Headquarters
-- ============================================================
UPDATE bars SET content = '<h3>The Vibe</h3>
<p>The Midway Pub is not just a bar that shows soccer -- it is the home of Footie Mob, one of Atlanta United''s original and most passionate independent supporter groups. On away match days, the scene at 552 Flat Shoals Ave is intense: flags draped from the ceiling, scarves around every neck, and chants that carry out to the street. This is East Atlanta Village at its most authentic -- a neighborhood pub where the regulars know each other by name and the soccer community is the beating heart of the place.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>The interior is a no-frills East Atlanta Village classic: dark wood, a long bar, big-screen TVs positioned for sightlines from every seat, and a projector for the main event. The real star is the massive outdoor patio, one of the biggest in the neighborhood, which is dog-friendly and kid-friendly during the day. When the weather cooperates, the patio becomes an open-air stadium of sorts, with fans spilling out with beers and plates of food.</p>

<h3>The Footie Mob</h3>
<p>Footie Mob predates Atlanta United''s on-field debut, having formed as one of the founding independent supporter groups. They have made The Midway their home turf, and every away match is an event. The energy mirrors what you would find in the supporter sections at Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- synchronized chants, tifo displays, and a level of passion that sets this apart from a typical sports bar. If you want to understand Atlanta''s soccer culture at the grassroots level, this is where you come.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>The menu is unpretentious pub fare done well. The garlic pretzels are a local favorite, the chicken fingers are legitimately great, and the burger holds its own against fancier options elsewhere in the neighborhood. The beer selection is huge, tilting toward craft, and prices are fair for the area. For morning Premier League matches, the kitchen opens early with a more limited menu.</p>

<h3>Who Goes There</h3>
<p>The crowd is a mix of die-hard Footie Mob members, East Atlanta Village locals, and soccer fans from around the city who know that this is where the atmosphere lives. It is not a corporate sports bar -- it is a neighborhood pub that happens to have one of the most passionate soccer communities in the American South. EPL mornings draw a smaller but dedicated crowd, while Atlanta United away matches pack the house.</p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>
<p>The Midway is in the heart of East Atlanta Village at the intersection of Flat Shoals and Glenwood. Street parking is available on surrounding blocks. Rideshare is recommended for match days when the lot fills up. It is about a 10-minute drive from Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p>'

-- MANNY'S GRANT PARK -- Atlanta Spurs (Tottenham) Home
-- ============================================================
UPDATE bars SET content = '<h3>The Vibe</h3>
<p>Manny''s Grant Park is the kind of neighborhood pub where you walk in as a stranger and leave knowing everyone at the bar. Located at 580 Woodward Ave in the heart of Grant Park, it has carved out a specific identity in Atlanta''s soccer landscape as the official home of the Atlanta Spurs, Tottenham Hotspur''s recognized supporters'' club. On match days, the pub takes on the feel of a mini-stadium, with Spurs fans in Lilywhite kits crowding around the screens, reacting to every tackle and near-miss in real time.</p>

<h3>The Spurs Connection</h3>
<p>The Atlanta Spurs supporters'' club was founded in 2012 and has grown steadily ever since. They chose Manny''s as their home bar because of the staff''s fantastic hospitality and the pub''s willingness to make match day a genuine event. Anytime Spurs are playing, you are guaranteed to find like-minded fans raising a glass together. The partnership between the club and the pub has been instrumental in creating a community that extends beyond just watching football -- it is a social hub for Tottenham fans across the metro area.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>Manny''s is not a massive sports bar with 50 screens. It is a cozy neighborhood pub with enough TVs to cover the matches that matter, and the atmosphere more than compensates for the intimate size. The bar area is the focal point on match days, with fans standing shoulder to shoulder. A spacious patio out back provides overflow seating on nice days, and the whole place has a warm, unpretentious feel that suits the Grant Park neighborhood perfectly.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>Quality pub food is the focus -- burgers, wings, and comfort fare that pairs well with a pint. The drink selection leans toward craft beers and classic cocktails. Nothing too fancy, nothing overpriced. It is the kind of place where you order without agonizing over the menu and are never disappointed.</p>

<h3>The Neighborhood</h3>
<p>Grant Park is one of Atlanta''s oldest and most charming neighborhoods, and Manny''s fits right in. It is conveniently located off I-20, near Oakland Cemetery and the Eastside Beltline, and less than a mile from the MLK MARTA stop. There is a small parking lot behind the pub plus ample free street parking on the surrounding blocks. The neighborhood is walkable, bikeable, and an easy rideshare from anywhere in the city.</p>

<h3>Beyond Spurs</h3>
<p>While the Tottenham connection is the headline, Manny''s is a good soccer pub in general. The staff will put on any match you want to watch, and the crowd is friendly to fans of all clubs. It is also just a great neighborhood bar for any occasion -- trivia nights, weekend brunch, or a casual weeknight pint. The Spurs identity gives it a specific character, but the hospitality extends to everyone.</p>'

-- FADO IRISH PUB (BUCKHEAD) -- Liverpool OLSC Atlanta Home
-- ============================================================
UPDATE bars SET content = '<h3>The Vibe</h3>
<p>Fado Buckhead is the grander, more expansive sibling to its Midtown counterpart, occupying a three-story building on Buckhead Avenue that includes multiple dining rooms and several rooftop patios. But on Premier League Saturday mornings, none of that matters except the screens and the scarves. This is the official home of OLSC Atlanta, the Official Liverpool Supporters Club, and when the Reds are playing, the pub belongs to them.</p>

<h3>The Liverpool Connection</h3>
<p>OLSC Atlanta is one of the larger Official Liverpool Supporters Clubs in the American South. They meet at Fado Buckhead for every Liverpool match, creating a sea of red in one of Atlanta''s most upscale neighborhoods. The group maintains an active presence on social media and runs events throughout the season. Their tagline, "Y''all Never Walk Alone," perfectly captures the blend of Liverpool tradition and Southern hospitality.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>The three-story layout means there is always room to spread out, and the rooftop patios offer a unique viewing experience on nice days. Like the Midtown location, the interior was designed and constructed in Ireland with authentic materials, deep woods, and traditional fixtures. Multiple screens on every level ensure you can follow the match from anywhere in the building. The Buckhead location tends to be slightly quieter than Midtown on non-Liverpool match days, making it a more relaxed option for a morning EPL session.</p>

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>The menu mirrors the Midtown location -- proper Irish pub food, a strong whiskey collection, and a well-poured pint of Guinness. Weekend brunch service is popular with the post-match crowd. The rooftop bar serves a full menu and is a destination in its own right during warm weather.</p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>
<p>Located in the heart of Buckhead Village, the pub is easily accessible from GA-400 and within walking distance of the Buckhead MARTA station. The pub validates parking for 3 hours at nearby Buckhead Village parking decks, which is a significant perk in one of Atlanta''s priciest parking neighborhoods.</p>'
