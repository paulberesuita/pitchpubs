# SoccerBars

The best soccer bars in America — curated for fans who want the real match-day experience.

---

## Overview

SoccerBars is a curated directory of 310+ soccer-friendly bars across 22 US cities. We help fans find the right place to watch — whether it's a 7:30 AM Premier League kickoff, a Champions League night, or a World Cup 2026 match. Every bar is verified through supporter communities, local fan groups, and real reviews.

**Who it's for:** Soccer fans who want more than a sports bar with a TV on mute. Fans looking for early opens, supporter group meetups, and genuine match-day atmosphere.

**What makes it useful:** Team/league affiliations per bar, early-open flags, neighborhood-level detail, and coverage across 22 cities — not just NYC and LA.

## Taste

**Mood:** Warm, vibrant, match-day energy. Like walking into your favorite pub before kickoff — green pitch tones, warm wood, and the buzz of anticipation.

**Palette:**
- Primary: `#1c1917` (near-black for text)
- Accent: `#166534` (pitch green — the color of the game)
- Background: `#fafaf9` (warm off-white)
- Surface: `#f5f5f4` (warm stone)

**Fonts:**
- Display: Epilogue — bold, confident headings
- Body: Inter — clean, readable body text

**Principles:** Restraint over flash. Let the bars speak for themselves. Warm tones, generous spacing, and enough green to say "soccer" without screaming it.

## Agents

Five autonomous agents that check state, decide what needs doing, and execute. Say a trigger word and they investigate the database, the site, the gaps — then come back with findings and a plan.

**setup** bootstraps a new directory from an idea — configures all files, picks a design, creates Cloudflare infrastructure, deploys, and seeds starter data.

**content** owns the data. Discovers items, researches details, fills images, builds content pages, fixes data quality. The site is only as good as its content.

**product** owns the experience. Builds mini apps, adds delightful touches, polishes the core pages. Taste is the compass — restraint, warmth, space, craft.

**seo** owns technical health. Audits meta tags, structured data, sitemaps, thin content, internal linking. Doesn't just recommend — builds and ships fixes.

**marketing** owns distribution. Outreach, partnerships, social content. Earns attention by sharing something remarkable, not by asking for links.

Each agent owns a clear domain with no overlap. Skills are the reusable playbooks they follow — research workflows, audit checklists, deploy procedures. Agents decide *what* to do; skills define *how* to do it.
